# fireplace-todo

A slighly modified version of the [Fireproof Netlify ToDo Example](https://github.com/fireproof-storage/todo-netlify) designed to work with [Fireplace](https://github.com/mschoch/fireplace)

Only changes were to sync with Fireplace instead of Netlify, and to remove the polling sync option (Fireplace uses websockets).
